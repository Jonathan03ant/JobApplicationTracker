# Job Application Tracker

## Description

Job Application Tracker (Zt-j-geez.com) is a web application built with React and Firebase that helps users manage their job applications. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can add, edit, go to the official job link, and delete job applications with the ability to add specific applications to a "Watchlist".

Each application has a tracking details such as the job title, company name, application status, and notes.

The application uses Firebase for user authentication and Firestore as a NoSQL database to store the job applications. It leverages the real-time capabilities of Firestore to ensure the data displayed to the user is always up-to-date.

The main goal of the Job Application Tracker is to simplify the job application process by providing a centralized platform where users can easily manage and track all their job applications.
